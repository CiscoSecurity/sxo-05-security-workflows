## Making a Suggestion
Have an idea for something we should develop? Please open an Issue on GitHub. Be sure to include:
1. Whether or not you're suggesting a workflow or atomic action
1. A detailed description of your suggestion
1. Links to any documentation, especially for relevant API calls

Keep in mind that we don't have access to every technology that exists, so if your suggestion is related to a closed system that requires payment or a subscription, we may not be able to get access to that system to develop content.
