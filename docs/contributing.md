## Submitting Your Content
If you've written a workflow or atomic action that you think we should add to the repository, you can:
* Open an Issue and attach the JSON of the workflow or atomic; or
* Fork the repository, add your content, and create a pull request for us to review

**Note: If your content does not follow our best practices, we will probably deny your request...**
