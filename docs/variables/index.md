# Variables
If you're familiar with any traditional scripting or software development, variables should be familiar. If not, don't worry, they're pretty simple! Variables are what orchestration uses to store information and pass it around between activities. You can have [global variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/variables/global) that are available to all of your workflows or define variables within a [workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/variables/workflow) itself.
