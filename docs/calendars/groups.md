# Groups
A group calendar allows you to combine multiple calendars into one. For example, if you want a workflow to run every Monday and every Friday, you could create a group calendar combining the **Every Monday** calendar with the **Every Friday** calendar. You can also exclude a calendar from a group if you want to skip specific days like holidays.

## Configuration
To configure a group calendar:

1. Give the calendar a meaningful **Display Name**.
1. Select a **Start Date** and **End Date** for the calendar. The calendar will go into effect starting on the start date and stop running on the end date.
1. Select one or more calendars to include in the group.
1. Select one or more calendars to exclude from the group.
1. Click **Submit**.

Here's a sample of a group calendar that will run every Monday and Friday in December excluding any holidays:
