# Calendars
Calendars define a collection of days that a [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedules) should be executed. When a schedule and calendar are combined, they can be used to [trigger]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/triggers) a workflow.

**Note:** Only a [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedules) can be used as a [trigger]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/triggers). You cannot use a calendar to trigger a workflow on its own, it must be part of a schedule.
