# Default Repositories
When a SecureX orchestration tenant is created, three default GitHub targets are created to import initial content. If you need to re-import any of the default atomic actions or workflows, you can use these repos to do so.

| Repository Name | Purpose |
|:----------------|:--------|
| Github_Target_Atomics | Default atomic actions for products like Threat Response and Webex |
| Github_Target_Utils | Utility workflows for tenant configuration and setup |
| Github_Target_Workflows | Default workflows |

## But wait, I don't have these...
Oops! If you're missing any of these repositories, something didn't go quite right when your tenant was provisioned. Please get in touch with [Cisco TAC](https://support.cisco.com) for help getting them created.
