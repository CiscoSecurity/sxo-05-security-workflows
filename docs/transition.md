# Transition to XDR
Cisco has announced that our new eXtended Detection and Response (XDR) product, Cisco XDR, will be made generally available at the end of July. This product is a new offering from Cisco but has some familiar components from Cisco SecureX, including an automation and orchestration feature. Cisco XDR will ultimately replace Cisco SecureX, but an exact timeline for the sunsetting of SecureX has not been decided.

While we prepare to launch Cisco XDR, a lot of work will be done to update and enhance our documentation. During this time, you will see mixed branding. As in, some documentation will refer to Cisco XDR Automation while other documentation may still refer to SecureX orchestration. Most of the concepts in SecureX orchestration apply to XDR Automation. Workflows and atomic actions that work in SecureX orchestration should work in XDR Automation.

Please be patient while we work to get all of this content updated for you. For those customers who remain on SecureX after Cisco XDR is launched, we'll do our best to make legacy documentation available as a reference.
