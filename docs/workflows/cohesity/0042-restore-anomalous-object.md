</div>

<div class="cisco-alert cisco-alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle mr-1 cisco-icon-info"></i> This workflow was developed and is supported by Cohesity</div>

This workflow restores the specified anomalous object to the latest clean snapshot in Cohesity Helios. It also resolves the alert on Helios once the restore task is triggered. The restored VM name will be in the format "Recover-{original VM name}-VM-{restore time}" and the restore task name on the cluster will be in the format "Cisco_SecureX_triggered_restore_task_{object name}". Supported observable: `hostname`

Note: This workflow is designed to be triggered from SecureX incidents generated by one of the following workflows:
* [0043 - Cohesity Helios - Ransomware Alerts to Threat Response]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/0043)
* [0044 - Cohesity Helios - Ransomware Alerts to SecureX/ServiceNow]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/0044)
