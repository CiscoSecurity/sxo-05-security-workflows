# Out of the Box Workflows
When a new SecureX orchestration tenant is provisioned, five "out of the box" workflows are automatically imported. These are simple [response workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/response) to help get you started with the product. Because of how these workflows are imported, the process to update them is a little different than our other workflows.

---

## Updating a Workflow
To update an out of the box workflow, you need to get the workflow's JSON from our [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/Main/Workflows-Default). You can either view the raw JSON and copy/paste it into SecureX orchestration OR you can download the raw JSON to a file and import the workflow as a file.

* More information about importing workflows can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/importing)
