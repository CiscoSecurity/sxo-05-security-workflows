# Set Variables
_Category: Core_

If you want to modify a variable's value, you can use the `Set Variables` activity. This activity can be used with global, input, output, and local variables. You can set one variable at a time or you can update multiple, as shown in this example:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/activities/set-variables/set-variables.png)

More information about variables can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/variables/).

## Hints
* A single `Set Variables` activity can update more than one variable, even if they're different types.
* You can't modify the value of a `Static` variable.
