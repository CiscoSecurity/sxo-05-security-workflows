## Atomic Actions
Atomic actions are self-contained workflows that are similar to a function in traditional programming. They can consume input, perform various actions, and then return output. They're designed to be portable, re-usable, and make building workflows more efficient.

## Workflows
Workflows are the larger component of orchestration and are similar to a script in traditional programming. A workflow can be simple and only have a few actions or be complex and string together many different actions for different products.
